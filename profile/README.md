# Developing GenAI powered web applications for survey and experimental research studies

[![Status: Active Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active_development-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)
**Welcome! This repository aims to provide researchers with useful materials for building and studying GenAI-powered web applications.**

The idea is to collaboratively build a collection of platform-agnostic methods, code snippets, tools, and analysis ideas useful for creating and studying how people engage with GenAI systems through web applications.

## Why This Repository?

Developing and studying GenAI-powered web applications often involves overcoming similar technical, ethical, and methodological challenges. This repository aims to help researchers:

* Getting help and support in how to develop and use GenAI web applications for research.
* Getting access to examples and use-cases of GenAI web applications that work and can be easily integrated into own research projects.
* Share early examples and approaches.
* Find inspiration or starting points for application designs and tools.
* Connect with others tackling similar challenges in GenAI-based web development.
* Gradually build a useful set of community resources over time.

## What's Here Now?

This profile "GenAI-interaction-research" is organized in repositories. The repository **".github"** is a central repository that entails all relevant information beyond individual applications. The other repositories contain individual web applications that has been developed and that can be used by other researchers. Particular instructions in how to implement the different individual applications can be found in each of the individual repositories.

- A **comprehensive guide** for developing GenAI-driven web applications, providing key questions and actionable guidance. You can access it here: [Overall Guide](https://genai-interaction-research.github.io/TOOL-decision_tree)
- A **Snippet Generator** to help you get started with your implementation. You can access it here: [Snippet Generator](https://genai-interaction-research.github.io/script_generator/)
- A **Deployment Guide** that helps to make the best decision where to host and deploy the developed backend. You can access it here: [Deployment Guide](https://genai-interaction-research.github.io/TOOL-deployment_guide)

At the moment there are the following developed web applications to showcase GenAI driven web applications:
- **Recommendation agent**: https://github.com/GenAI-interaction-research/podcast_recommender
- **Image generation and editing tool**: https://github.com/GenAI-interaction-research/qualtrics_image_gen_edit

In the central ".github" repository there are the following documents:
- A **rule template** that can be integrated into an AI-augmented IDE like Cursor or Windsurf. This rule template instructs the AI to be particularly helpful for designing secure GenAI web applications that are oriented on the approach discussed in this paper https://github.com/GenAI-interaction-research/.github/blob/main/250424_GenAI_web_apps_v0.1.pdf.

Other researchers are encouraged to share and provide their working web applications as well as other ideas and work that might be of help for other researcher.

**➡️ A Note on Ethics:** All applications should adhere to ethical principles, such as protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency when using GenAI. Proper handling of user data, compliance with GDPR or other regulations, and clear communication about AI usage are crucial.

## Getting Started
