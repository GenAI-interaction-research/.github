# Developing GenAI powered web applications for experimental research studies

[![Status: Active Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active_development-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)
**Welcome! This repository aims to provide researchers with useful materials for building and studying GenAI-powered web applications.**

The idea is to collaboratively build a collection of platform-agnostic methods, code snippets, tools, and analysis ideas useful for creating and studying how people engage with GenAI systems through web applications.

## Why This Repository?

Developing and studying GenAI-powered web applications often involves overcoming similar technical, ethical, and methodological challenges. This repository aims to help developers and researchers:

* Share early examples and approaches that worked.
* Find inspiration or starting points for application designs and tools.
* Connect with others tackling similar challenges in GenAI-based web development.
* Gradually build a useful set of community resources over time.

## What's Here Now? (Initial Showcases)

Right now, this repository contains a few **initial examples and showcases**. These are intended to illustrate the *types* of resources we hope the community might share and develop here, such as:

* **Web Application Design Patterns:** Insights and best practices for integrating GenAI into web applications, such as common workflows for chatbots, real-time collaboration tools, or creative content generators.
* **Code Snippets & Tool Examples:** Example implementations using popular technologies like:
  - Frontend frameworks: **React**, **Vue.js**, **Svelte**.
  - Backend frameworks: **Flask**, **Django**, **Express.js**.
  - Generative AI APIs: **OpenAI API**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, or **custom ML models**.
* **End-to-End Use Cases:** Tutorials for building a GenAI-powered application, such as:
  - A dynamic Q&A chatbot for customer support.
  - A content generation tool for blogs and marketing.
  - Real-time collaboration tools powered by AI.

**➡️ A Note on Ethics:** All applications should adhere to ethical principles, such as protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency when using GenAI. Proper handling of user data, compliance with GDPR or other regulations, and clear communication about AI usage are crucial.
