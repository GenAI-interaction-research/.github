# Exploring Human-Generative AI Interaction Observation

[![Status: WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work_in_progress-orange.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md) **Welcome! This repository aims to become a shared space for researchers interested in observing human interaction with Generative AI.**

We're just getting started. The idea is to collaboratively build a collection of platform-agnostic methods, code snippets, tools, and analysis ideas useful for studying how people engage with GenAI systems.

## Why This Repository?

Studying human-GenAI interaction often involves similar technical or methodological hurdles. We hope this space can eventually help researchers:

* Share early examples and approaches that worked.
* Find inspiration or starting points for study designs and tools.
* Connect with others tackling similar observation challenges.
* Gradually build a useful set of community resources over time.

## What's Here Now? (Initial Showcases)

Right now, this repository contains a few **initial examples and showcases**. These are intended to illustrate the *types* of resources we hope the community might share and develop here, such as:

* **Ideas for Protocols & Designs:** Early thoughts or examples for setting up observational studies.
* **Code Snippets & Tool Examples:** Some basic code (Python, JavaScript, etc.) related to interaction interfaces, logging, or simple analysis.

**➡️ A Note on Ethics:** All research involving humans needs careful ethical planning (e.g., IRB/REC approval). Any shared methods or data discussion here should respect participant privacy and consent. We primarily focus on tools and methods, not participant data itself.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the current examples.

* Check out the folders to see the showcases.
* Use the **[Discussions](link-to-discussions-tab)** tab to ask questions or see what others are discussing. *(<- Ensure Discussions are enabled in repo settings)*
* Look at the **[Issues](link-to-issues-tab)** tab for specific requests or feedback on the examples.

## How You Can Contribute (Let's Build This Together!)

Since this repository is just starting, contributions of all kinds are welcome!

* **Share Your Examples:** Have a script, protocol idea, analysis approach, or useful link relevant to observing GenAI interaction? Please **share it in the [Discussions](link-to-discussions-tab)** tab! Describing your idea or attaching files is great.
* **Ask Questions / Start Discussions:** Have a challenge or question? Others might too! Start a discussion thread.
* **Give Feedback:** Thoughts on the current examples? Please **open an [Issue](link-to-issues-tab)**.
* **Improve Resources:** As things develop, contributions via **Pull Requests** to refine code or documentation will also be welcome.

We're still figuring out the best contribution process, but you can find our initial thoughts in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. *(<- You need to create this file, perhaps starting simply)*

## Community Guidelines

Let's aim for a welcoming and constructive environment. Please follow the guidelines outlined in **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. *(<- You need to create this file)*

## Licensing

Our intention is for resources shared here to be openly reusable. A specific open license will be chosen and placed in the **[LICENSE](LICENSE)** file soon. *(<- You need to choose and create this file)*

## Questions?

Feel free to open an Issue or start a Discussion thread!

*Thanks for checking out this early-stage project! We look forward to building a valuable resource together.*
